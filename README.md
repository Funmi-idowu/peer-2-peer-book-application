# Book Review Application
## By Funmi Idowu

## Project Proposal

In an era where literature thrives and readers seek insights into their next captivating read, centralized platforms often dictate the discourse around books, limiting diverse perspectives and impeding organic interactions. Our proposal is to develop a decentralized peer-to-peer (P2P) book review application, empowering readers to share, discover, and discuss books freely.

### Application Overview:

This application will provide a platform for readers to create book reviews, publish book reviews, list books of interest, list other peers we discovered on the network, list published book reviews of a given peer and list all book reviews of all peers we know

### Key Features:

Decentralized Reviews: Readers can post reviews and ratings for books without reliance on central servers, ensuring diverse perspectives and uncensored opinions.
Peer Discovery: Users can connect with fellow readers through decentralized mechanisms, facilitating organic interactions and diverse literary discussions.
Secure Communication: Encrypted communication ensures privacy and integrity in discussions, fostering trust among users.

### Utilizing P2P Network:

The P2P network forms the backbone of our book review application, enabling decentralized storage and communication.

- Distribution: Reviews are distributed across multiple network nodes, ensuring redundancy and availability.
- Peer Discovery: Peers announce their presence within the network, facilitating organic connections and fostering a vibrant community of readers.

This decentralized peer-to-peer book review application empowers readers to engage in open, diverse discussions about literature, free from the constraints of centralized platforms. By leveraging a P2P network, the exchange of literary insights while preserving user privacy and fostering a dynamic community of readers is facilitated.
